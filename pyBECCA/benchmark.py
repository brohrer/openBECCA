benchmark 0.1.0

A suite of worlds to characterize the performance of BECCA variants.
Other agents may use this benchmark as well, as long as they have the 
same interface. (See BECCA documentation for a detailed specification.)

This benchmark more heavily values breadth than virtuosity. Agents that
can perform a wide variety of tasks moderately well will score better 
than agents that perform a single task optimally and all others very poorly.

In order to facilitate apples-to-apples comparisons between agents, the 
benchmark will be version numbered.
