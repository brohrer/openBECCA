BECCA version 0.4.x

This code implements a brain-emulating cognition and control
architecture (BECCA). A BECCA agent is placed in various
worlds to seek reward. Worlds may be physical or simulated.

To run it, configure the tester.py module to select a world
and run it as main in a python interpreter.

To create worlds of your own, extend the template class
WorldInterface ( in the module world_interface.py). 
Its documentation explains what you methods you will
need to flesh out. Copying and pasting from other worlds has proven 
effective as well.
